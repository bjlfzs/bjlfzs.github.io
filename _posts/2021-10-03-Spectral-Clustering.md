最近正在进行对于multiview clustering的学习，其中着重学习了谱聚类以及相关的算法，在这里先简单总结一下，随着学习的深入再慢慢补充。

<h3 data-toc-skip>概述</h3>

<h3>距离度量</h3>

其主要解决如何将采样点数据构造成图结构的问题。其中两点间的距离有三种构图方式:

\1. $ε$ -neighborhood
\2. k-nearest neighborhood
\3. fully connected

## Paragraph

I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

## Mermaid SVG

```mermaid

```


## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
